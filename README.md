## Full Stack code challenge
Build a memory card game that can be played in a browser with the ability to return to it at a later time, potentially from another browser or device.

## Rules:
- Generate a game of configurable size.
- Player can turn over any two cards that are not matched yet.
- If the two cards match, keep them flipped over.
- If they don't match, turn them back over after a pause.
- Repeat 2-4 until game is solved.
- Indicate to the user that the game is completed and show the number of turns it took to complete
- Provide ability to save the game and be able to return to it at a later time.

## Bonus:
- Game is playable on any device size
- Es6 syntax
- Animations
- History of game scores

## Some basic rules to keep in mind:
- Use any programming language on the backend you're comfortable with as long as the implementation is object-oriented
- API requests and responses should be in a JSON format
- If you have questions, please let me know and I will put you in touch with someone from our Engineering team
- Show us your creativity! :-)

## Time Effort
Expected time to spend is about 2 hours, but you can take as much time as you would like.
